Ideas: 
    It should be a card game, similar to Blizzard's Hearthstone.
    
    There should be some "heroes" or "classes" with class-specific cards and some neutral cards, available for all classes.
    
    Each player builds his deck with *30* cards. Deck is divided in 2 parts - "base"-cards and "combat"-cards. 
    Base cards may increase players resources, or summon buildings. Combat cards may cast spells, or summon units.
    
    * Base/Combat-cards: There shouldn't be more than 3-5 base-cards per class. From the beginning each player gets *3* combat 
        cards and *1* base-card. Each turn player pulls 1 combat and 1 base card, until all of them are gone. 

    * Base-cards idea: those cards should summon buildings. Buildings are just "fat" units, with ability of summoning unlimited 
    number of combat units - one per turn, for some *mana cost*.     

    * I should also try to balance cards/abilities so the game will be interesting to play, but this comes secondarily to crating 
    a good engine.   

What should happen:
    On game start
        * 2 players are placed, first one is chosen                 DONE
        * Player's decks are being shuffled                         DONE

    Turn start: 
        * Player gets 1 combat + 1 base card (if there are still some). If there are no cards, player gets penalty (to avoid long games)  DONE
        * Player gets +1 of total mana (max - *10*)                 DONE

    Turn:
        * Turn lasts max 2 minutes
        * Player may use his units to attack enemy units/buildings/hero; use buildings to summon units;     2/3 DONE
            cast spells; summon new units from cards

    Game over: 
        * One player's health drops under 0                 

Mechanics:
    
    What can spells do:
        * Deal damage to unit                                       DONE
        * Heal unit/heroes                                          1/2 DONE
        * Add new quality to units                                  DONE
        * Modify unit's properties (damage, current health, max health) DONE
        * Remove all buffs/qualities from unit                      DONE
        * Destroy unit                                              
        * Apply those effects to 1 - random number - all units of the player - all units 3/4 DONE

    What qualities may units have:
        * Normal unit                                               DONE
        * Stealth (can't be targeted by direct attacks, looses this quality on attack) 
        * Taunt (other units without this quality may not be attacked) DONE
        * Charge (attacks as soon as summoned)                      DONE

    What "powers" may unit posess
        * Battlecry (use ability as soon as he summoned)    
        * Deathrate (use ability on death)
        * Aura (affects other units, while this one lives)
        * End turn effect

    Auras:
        * Change health
        * Change damage
        * Change summon cost
        * Add quality

    Effects may apply to:
        * *self* (on powers)
        * *target/attacker* (on powers)
        * randomly chosen unit(s) (w/wo repeats)                    DONE
        * player-chosen unit    
        * neighbor units

    Effects may occur on following events:
        * newly created units
        * before/after unit is attacked 
        * before/after unit dies

Cards: 

    Base-cards types: 
        * Gain mana (active/available from the next turn)
        * Summon building 

    Combat-cards types:
        * Cast spell 
        * Create unit (placed on the left side, or where player chooses him to be)

    Units: 
        * May attack player-chosen units, can't attack allies

    Buildings: 
        * May create units on the same turn, or X turns after (if survives)
        * May give spell cards on the same turn, or X turns after (lasts 1 turn, dispose later) 


How should it all happen:
    
    Deck shuffle: on the game start, cards are being validated (no more than *2* cards of each type, etc)

    Player uses a spell: 
        0) Check unit cost (with all buffs)         1/2 DONE
        1) Choose target(s)                         
        2) Apply spell                              1/3 DONE

    Player uses unit card: 
        1) Check unit cost (with all buffs) 
        1.1) Remove mana
        2) Place unit
        3) See, if it triggers some "newly created unit" spell
        4) If unit has no charge, disable it's attack ability
        5) If unit has some battlecry effect, apply it
        
    Unit attacks:
        1) Check, if target is valid (he has taunt, or no other taunt is in bound)
        2)
